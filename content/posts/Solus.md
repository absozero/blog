Solus is a project I have been looking at and contributing to recently - it is a machine learning project that aims to create a fully end-to-end project after being given a specific spec and instructions to follow.

Solus is created and maintained by CSX Labs, a collection of open reseach laboratories, who are committed to building software to benifit humanity.

By making a project like `solus`, which is a ai-based project generator, open source, it can cause the growth of AI into software development areas, and this project can be contributed to by anybody willing to contribute and help grow the project.

The project is still in a development stage and is not ready for actual usage just yet.
